== [ERROR] you didn't set a token for authentication to semgrep.dev.

You tried logging in as deployment ID #0, but the deployment's API token is set to '' (an empty string).
If you're using a CI secret management feature to set it, please ensure that your token secret (commonly named SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN) is available to this CI job.
